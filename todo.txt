Step 1:
-------------------------

+ Design and implement GUI
	Start with simple layout just to focus on functionality 

Step 2:
-------------------------

+ Server:Rest API with services to get list of targets
	(Look into Jersey and how to inject reference to other objects)
	List of targets (Move target table to common and allow sharing through API)
	Reserve target
	Release target
	Get random target
	Status of server, connected clients etc

+ Authentication solution. Maybe through REST API.

+ Investigate if we are allowed to use a dump of a restricted are to public use

+ Own message resender cache of all position reports
	Seems impossible as resender is destroyed when settings are changed
	Get from cache when sending (do transformation and replace in cache)
	Maybe last received for all targets is also needed to allow timeout

+ Time stamping in stream option (Maybe GPS message see EPD-ship)
