Step 2:
-------------------------

+ Server:Rest API with services to get list of targets
	Status of server, connected clients etc
	
+ GUI: Exit button and not close on exit (if not using embedded setting)
	Exit must shutdown before exit

+ Maybe dangerous senteces like PSTT that needs to be removed
	Take out timestamp
	Crop to VDM's (CropTransformer)

+ Maybe VDO converter needs to be able to convert BS -> AI
	(Talker transformer)

+ Anonymous: Random country + counter

+ Anonymous: Option to use random name file

+ Anonymous: Random callsign (UUID)




+ Investiage why server blocks on shutdown


Later 
-------------------------

+ Documentation

+ Setup on cloudbees

+ Time stamping in stream option (Maybe GPS message see EPD-ship)

+ Reduce stacktrace dumps
